## Features

The challenge involved integrating with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the Frontend Mentor designs.

You can:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a specific country
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country card to see more detailed information
- Navigate countries using a country's border countries links
- Back button mirrors browser's back button behavior
- Toggle between light and darkmode. Browser remembers your preference (TODO: Fix initial flash when using darkmode)
- Toggling theme modes triggers light on or off sound effects
- Displays country card loaders during initial API call
